# Angular CRUD Data Table

This is a simple tutorial that explores the making basic CRUD calls to a mocked json-server as well as implementing the fundamentals of the Material component library, specifically data-tables and dialogs. 

The project also follows best practices by segregating services from UI components so there is a separation of concerns and observance of the single-responsibility principle.
